/* A multiplayer word-guessing game is one where one player needs to input words and another player guesses the same word.



Write a class, WordEntry, with a String field to store player inputs. Override the equals() method in a way that compares the words while ignoring all spaces and cases. The program determines the winner of a word-guessing game, where player 2 wins upon successfully guessing the word entered by player 1, and player 1 emerges victorious if player 2 fails to guess the word.

Input format :

The first line of input consists of a string, representing the word entered by player 1.

The second line consists of a string, representing the word entered by player 2.

Output format :

The output displays a string representing the winner of the game.



Refer to the sample output for the exact text.

Code constraints :

In this scenario, the test cases fall under the following constraints:

1 ≤ length of the input strings ≤ 100 characters

Sample test cases :

Input 1 :

Red Apple

red apple

Output 1 :

Player 2 wins!

Input 2 :

Java Programming

Programming Python

Output 2 :

Player 1 wins!

Input 3 :

Laptop

lap t o p

Output 3 :

Player 2 wins!
