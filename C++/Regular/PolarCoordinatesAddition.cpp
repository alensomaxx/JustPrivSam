/*Design a class polar which describes a point in the plane 
using polar coordinates radius and angle. A point in polar 
coordinates is shown 
Use the overloaded + operator to add two objects of polar 

Note that we cannot add polar values of two points directly. 
This requires first the conversion of points into rectangluar co-ordinates, then adding 
the corresponding rectangluar co-ordinates and finally converting the result back into 
polar co-ordinates. yoou need to use the following trignometric formulae:
x=r*cos(a)
y=r*sin(a)
a=atan(y/x)
r=sqrt(x*x + y*y)
